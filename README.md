# Coursera Course Dataset project

In this project, I’m analyzing a dataset of 890 Coursera courses using Python (mainly pandas, NumPy) and visualizing insights with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The work was done using Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab.

## Project Goals
The main goal is to explore the structure of the dataset, check for missing or unusual values, and uncover interesting trends in course ratings, enrollment numbers, difficulty levels, certificate types, and course providers. This is a hands-on exercise to practice real-world data analysis using pandas and data visualization libraries.

The project is divided into five main parts:

**Data Preparation**

**Data Cleaning**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Outlier Analysis**

**Bivariate Analysis**

## Key Insights 
* Beginner and Mixed-level courses attract the highest enrollments overall.
* Mixed-level courses are only available as regular courses (no certificates).
* Beginner-level courses are much more popular than Intermediate or Advanced ones — likely because they’re more accessible.
* Advanced-level courses are less common and have lower average enrollments, probably because they target niche audiences.
* Professional Certificates bring in the highest average number of students (~190.7K), even though there are fewer of them.
* Specialization and regular Course certificates have similar, moderate enrollment levels.
